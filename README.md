While you may think it is a delicious and savory meal you often have containing chicken🍗 ,carrots🥕, onions🧅 and maybe even some broccoli🥦 on a rainy days, we're here to say that this isn't the case with _sooup_. _sooup_ is a simple to use online platform for your tired soul to recollect, and reconnect in a non-mentally and socially invasive way. 

For those with mental illnesses, or struggling with their mental illnesses, it is often hard to gather energy to interact with friends and family. Those who are intensely struggling with their mental health may be a harm to themselves. By offering a less intrusive way for loved ones to inquire on the individual's well being and possible location if needed.



## Features

❤ You can make the space your own by being able to add stickers, photos, change background colours.

💛 Todo list section is also handy and at bay, as it is often helpful for those struggling with mental health issues, as motivation depletion is often a large daily hinderance

Most of us didn't have Apple devices, so carrying out such implementations would have been difficult in such little time. Future Apple store app launch can be expected as it was the main intention. Please refer to the recorded video for further explaination on this.
